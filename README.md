# chickens-game
 An Idle/Inventory Management game based on chickens and eggs.
 
# Premise
 It's been a long time since I worked on this game, but the idea from what I remember was similar to other idle games, like [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), where you are constantantly trying to get more and more of *something*, in this game's case â€” eggs and money.

Essentially, your Inventory starts with a single Golden Egg, which when hatched has a 100% chance of hatching a chicken. The chickens will lay normal eggs every so often, which can then be hatched for a chance to get another chicken or sold for money. You could assign jobs to the chickens to have them collect new resources, allowing you to create new items.

# Inventory
The inventory is a grid of slots, each capable of holding a single type of item.

Double-clicking on an item opens a window, displaying the details and operations available for that item.

Scriptable Objects were used to easily create new items and specify what options where available for that item's info window.
